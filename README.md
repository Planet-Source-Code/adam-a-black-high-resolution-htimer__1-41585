## High Resolution hTimer


</div>

### Description

hTimer is a mutlimedia timer class which can tick at intervals of 1ms using the timeSetEvent API. I have looked at other similar code and altered mine so that it doesn't crash when run compiled.

You can use import it into your project (1 Class and 1 Module) or you can just compile it to a dll file. This is described in the Readme.txt file included.

This timer uses the Formless timer Demo form to show the usage of the timer.

Although I didn't code every single aspect of this and used peoples code to assist with subclassing and stuff I still put this together and rewrote a lot stuff to suit my activex dll.

Please vote if you have time. I never get votes anymore, not sure why...
